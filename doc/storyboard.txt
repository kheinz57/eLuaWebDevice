Welcome to the introduction of the project eLuaWebDevice
Let's start with some rationals.
All the web developers are developing software pretty agil.
But we - the embedded folks - are still pretty slow
One reason is that we face real world challenges like safety.
the  other cause is our limitation in deployment infrastructure
This can't really be solved easily for isolated devices.
Those things without connection to the world aaa internet.
But fortunately this is an endangered species. More and more
devices are getting connected to the big net. 

But this still hasn't changed the way we develop embedded devices.

The net nowadays is more like an constantly changing organism then
a fixed set of requirements you have to fullfill. Can we deal with 
that?

Configuration is the other issue we face. Those devices have to be
cheap. Can you afford sending a specialist to a remote place, setting
it up? Not really. Plug and play is the way to go.  At least for the internet connection. All the other effort is best done whereever you
can start a webbrowser.

Thinking about the paradigm 'programming over configuration'
combined with the wish to deploy often lead me to this dream:

A cheap device with connection to the internet and a hardware-id
gets its application from a server on the net. In case the net isn't
available it uses the previously downloaded and stored version from 
for the internal flash or sd-card.

Those applications are developed directly in the webbrowser. No special
IDE. No programm to install. Useable wherever a webbrowser is available.

By the time I came accross Lua - even more eLUA - I found a simple 
solution for my dream.
